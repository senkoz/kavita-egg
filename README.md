# kavita-egg 

This is a egg for the software Pterodactyl that creates a server running Kavita.  

Check out https://www.kavitareader.com/

## Installation

Install how you would any other pterodactyl egg.

1. Go to your admin panel

2. Click on a button called nests 

3. Create a new nest or import this egg into one you already have.

4. Then you can click on the servers tab

5. Create server 

6. Fill out everything  (I would recommend the default port of 5000)

7. Make sure to select the nest the Kavita egg is in and the egg its self.

8. Click create. Wait 5~ mintues for it to install. 
## FAQ

#### Does this already have varibles to easily change the port?

As of right now no. I am working on it! For now go to Kavita/config/appsettings.json

#### When i open the Kavita folder i get this banner on my screeen "This directory is too large to display in the browser, limiting the output to the first 250 files."

Due to limitations with base pterodactyl, you will need to use a software that does SFTP to view all the files. (WinSCP, etc)
